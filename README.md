# MorphoCloud On-Demand Instances: Run SlicerMorph inside a web browser.

Powerful virtual machines (compute instances) that provide interactive remote
desktop interface with [3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org) and
[SlicerMorph](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/blob/master/README.md)
preloaded for 3D digital morphology and morphometrics data processing.

To get more information about these instances, please review
[this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WRds-QWnDK1MnmEhGUPyBgjE9hitiddcElAPWiAYRg4/edit#heading=h.b0yi3m7wlfk8).

In a nutshell, you:

1. Have a research and/or teaching focus centered on 3D biological structure
   (e.g., 3D morphometrics, or visualization);
2. Need occasional access to powerful computers with large amounts of RAM
   (125GB), cores (32), and optionally with a GPU (A100) to work with large
   datasets;
3. You have a github account;
4. You have an ORCID with a public profile.

## MorphoCloud Desktop

- **A:** Shortcuts to commonly used tools and applications. From left to right,
  minimize/maximize open applications, 3D Slicer, Terminal (aka shell console)
  window, File Browser, Firefox web browser, Application Search, File Browser.

- **B:** Right mouse clicking anywhere on desktop brings this menu, which lists
  all the applications and settings.

- **C:** Shortcut to your persistent storage volume, **MyData**. The actual
  folder is `/media/volume/MyData`.

- **D:** Side toolbar that gets activated by pressing the `CTRL (or CMD)` +
  `ALT` + `SHIFT` keys. It allows copy/paste into the remote session, browse and
  download files on the remote drive and adjust screen zoom levels (cut from the
  screenshot).

- **E:** Click on this icon anytime to extend your session for additional 4
  hours.
