# MorphoCloud On-Demand Instances

Powerful virtual machines (compute instances) that provide interactive remote
desktop interface with [3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org) and
[SlicerMorph](https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph) preloaded for 3D
digital morphology and morphometrics data processing.

To get more information about these instances, please review
[this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WRds-QWnDK1MnmEhGUPyBgjE9hitiddcElAPWiAYRg4/edit#heading=h.b0yi3m7wlfk8).

In a nutshell, you:

1. Have a research and/or teaching focus centered on 3D biological structure
   (e.g., 3D morphometrics, or visualization);
2. Need occassional access to powerful computers with large amount of RAM
   (125GB), cores (32), and optionally with a GPU (A100) to work with large
   datasets;
3. You have a github account;
4. You have an ORCID with a public profile;

### FUNDING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

MorphoCloud services, including MorphoCloud OnDemand Instances, are supported by
funding from National Science Foundation (DBI/2301405) and National Institutes
of Health (NICHD/HD104435). MorphoCloud runs on cyberinfrastructure that is made
available by current and previous funding from by National Science Foundation
(Jetstream2: OAC/2005506, Exosphere: TI/2229642). Initial development of
SlicerMorph was previously supported by National Science Foundation
(DBI/1759883).

If you use any of the MorphoCloud services for your project, please acknowledge
our funders with this statement:

“This study relied on cyberinstructure supported by grants from National Science
Foundation (MorphoCloud: DBI/2301405; JetStream2: OAC/2005506; Exosphere:
